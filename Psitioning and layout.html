If you give a negative value to the "top" property, in which direction will the box be moved?
up


When the "float" property is used with the values of "left" or "right", anything else that lives in the containing element will:
flow around the element associated with the "float" property


When the text needs more space than the dimensions of the box, the browser shows scrolls for the overflow property with the values of "scroll" and:
auto


Assign width of 500px to the "text" element and enable fixed scrollbars:
#text {
overflow:scroll;
height: 200px;
width: 500px;
}



Fill in the blanks and make the blue box disappear from the webpage:
#red {
position : absolute;
top: 100px;
left: 100px;
z-index: 20;
}
#blue {
position: relative;
z-index: 50;
display: none;
}
